<p STYLE="font: 12pt Georgia; color: white"> 
	Roots is a company that designs products with the purpose bringing you a little bit closer to home.
We take all different kinds of wood and do our best to make anything from wall art to family furniture. 
The goal is simple here, create products designed in a way that will take the customer back to their roots.
</p>
<p STYLE="font: 12pt Georgia; color: white">To the right you will see our three most recent pieces of work.
	We believe these three pieces of work describe our company very well. Beginning with the Atlanta Skyline, with time and patience this
skyline was burned by hand deep into the grain of the wood. After the burn was complete we rubbed a nice stain around
the outline of the skyline really pop. This piece of art was designed for those who love the city in which they are from, 
so when they look at the skyline of their home they are filled with good memories.</p>
 <p STYLE="font: 12pt Georgia; color: white">	The book Case was brought together with natural pine and 
stained with a nice golden finish. This was brought together with the purpose of having access to the words that 
matter to you most. What makes this so table top book case so great is the ability to put it on almost any surface
of your choice. This is a true fan favorite.</p>
<p STYLE="font: 12pt Georgia; color: white">	Finally, the Farmer Style Family Table is made with the sole purpose of bringing families together. We believe
days are best spent working and playing, but all days should end around the table reconnecting with one another.
This table creates just that opportunity.</p>
